    "Many companies are built around lessening one’s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.\n",

    "With this context, EDSA is challenging you during the Classification Sprint with the task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the modern business landscape, many organizations are passionately embedding eco-conscious principles into their foundation, seeking to mitigate environmental impacts and promote sustainability. These companies offer a variety of products and services that align seamlessly with their green ethos. A crucial part of their strategic marketing is understanding how the public perceives the looming threat of climate change and the extent to which they view it as an immediate concern. This knowledge will provide a critical lens through which to anticipate how their offerings may resonate with potential consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set against this backdrop, EDSA puts forth an exhilarating challenge during the Classification Sprint. Participants are tasked to construct a machine learning model with the ability to discern whether individuals believe in climate change or not, harnessing the power of unique tweet data for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive and precise solution to this challenge equips businesses with a key to unlock expansive consumer sentiment insights. These insights cut across a diverse array of demographic and geographic categories, paving the way for an enriched understanding that can underpin and shape their future marketing strategies"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Companies operating in various industries need a reliable solution to understand the sentiments expressed by Twitter users regarding climate change. This information is crucial for making informed decisions, developing effective marketing strategies, and aligning their messaging with public sentiment. However, without a robust classification model, companies face challenges in accurately predicting sentiment and extracting valuable insights from the vast amount of data available on social media platforms. To address this problem, companies require a comprehensive sentiment analysis model that can provide real-time monitoring, sentiment classification, and trend analysis to help them stay ahead of the curve and effectively respond to the evolving concerns and preferences of their target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we set out to analyze tweets collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018 regarding climate change. We further wish to train a suitable and high performing classification model, to help classify the tweets into their respective sentiment categories regarding climate change."
